Question 1
What data have you gathered, and how did you gather it?
Answer 1
I gathered Lot Number, Lot Type, Sample Point, Sample Collection Date, Organism Name, and Organism Count online from a product that no
longer exists.
Question 2
Which areas of the data have you cleaned, and which areas still need cleaning?
Answer 2
I did some of the data cleaning in Excel instead of Python. The majority of the hundreds of data points I gathered were 0 CFU/mL or 
0 CFU/plate for growth. Since that skews the data, I filtered them out. In Python, I removed the species from Organism Name and only kept 
the genus since my assumption was that the same genus behaves similarly. I could add in a feature that groups the different Organism Name
by type-bacteria, mold, and yeast-instead of lumping them all together as bacteria.
Question 3
What steps have you taken to explore the data?
Answer 3
I created histograms of mean bacterial growth by Month and by Year. I also ran Confusion Matrices and Feature Importance for
Linear (Logistic Regression), Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Question 4
What insights have you gained from your exploration?
Answer 4
None of my models do a good job of estimating bacterial contamination. Based on the Confusion Matrices, I can predict the True 0 fairly 
well. I have a hard time predicting True 1.
Question 5
Will you be able to answer your question with this data, or do you need to gather more data (or adjust your question)?
Answer 5
I don't know if I will be able to answer my question of modeling bacterial population based on feature importances. Random features are
coming up as important. For ex. 'Unattainable' which shows up when there's lack of information keeps coming up as the most important
feature. This does not help.
Question 6
How might you use modeling to answer your question?
Answer 6
I'm not sure how to use modeling to answer my question. I don't know if there is a pattern for bacteria.
